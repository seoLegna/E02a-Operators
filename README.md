# E02a-Operators


This project taught me a lot about python's inbuilt functions and how and where to use them.
It also helped me understand what the random module is all about and how and where it can be used.
I learnt that the random.shuffle operator suffles the original list thus you had to use the random.sample operator to create a new randomized list and effectively and properly answer the question. It also taught me a lot about python lists.
The exercise was a lot of fun to work through and very knowledge building.
I learnt many ways to certain opretors I had never ever seen before.
This was a great exercise.
